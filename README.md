Provides messenging features for your Symfony2 application.

The persistence is storage agnostic. Any backend can be implemented: Doctrine, Propel, and others.
Actually the Doctrine MongoDB implementation is complete.

MessageBundle supports threads, spam detection, soft deletion and messenging permissions.

MessageBundle can be used with FOS\UserBundle, but it is not required.
